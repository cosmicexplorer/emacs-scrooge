emacs-scrooge
=============

[scrooge](https://twitter.github.io/scrooge/) support for emacs. Currently just depends on the `thrift` package for indentation, and completely redoes the `font-lock-defaults` so that scrooge's `#@namespace scala` lines are highlighted (along with many more fun highlighting improvements)!
